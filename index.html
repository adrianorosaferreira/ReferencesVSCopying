        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        // const copy = players;

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // copy[3] = 'Adriano';

        // now here is the problem!
        // console.log(players, copy);

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way
        const copy = players.slice();

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const copy2 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const copy3 = [...players];

        const copy4 = Array.from(players);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        // const captain = person;
        // captain.number = 99;

        // console.log(captain, person);

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const captain = Object.assign({}, person);

        console.log(captain);
        const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
            number: 99
        });
        console.log(captain2);


        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
